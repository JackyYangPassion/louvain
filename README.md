Java implementation of the Louvain method for community detection.  

Input: weighted, undirected graph, defined in a CSV file as a list of edges.  See the graphs at src/test/resources for examples.  If nodes are named or non-zero indexed they can also be read.

Although it is licensed under MIT, I have realised that one of its dependencies, trove4j, is licensed under GNU.  So if you want to use this for commercial purposes you will want to remove that dependency, which shouldn't be too difficult.
